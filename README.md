# Top-k Queries

This repository contains an implementation of a Top-k Queries algorithm in Java, which aggregates individual item scores from three sources. The items can be restaurants, with each source representing a restaurant review site (e.g., Google, TripAdvisor, Yelp). The individual score of an item in one source is the average of the ratings it received on that site.

## Overview

The Top-k Queries algorithm is designed to aggregate scores from multiple sources and identify the top `k` items based on their combined scores.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 12 or higher
